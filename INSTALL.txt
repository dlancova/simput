The installation of this package is based on the GNU autotools.

If you checked out the sources directly from the repository you first
have to create a configure script from the existing 'configure.ac'.
For this purpose go into the main directory of the package (where
there is this file) and run the 'autoreconf' command belonging to the
GNU autotools.  (If you extraced the code from the .tar.gz archive,
you can skip the following step and continue with the next paragraph.)

 cd simput/
 autoreconf --install

This basically generates the 'configure' script (and some
'Makefile.in's). In the next step you have to run the 'configure'
script to produce 'Makefile's for the compilation and installation of
the software.  At this point you also have to specify the installation
directory. The default setting on most platforms is '/usr/local',
i.e. the binaries will be installed to '/usr/local/bin', the libraries
to '/usr/local/lib' etc. This setting can be changed using the
'--prefix' option of the 'configure' script.  So for a local
installation, e.g. type:

 ./configure --prefix=$HOME

Now the 'Makefile's to compile and install the software should be available.
To continue type:

 make
 make install

If everything worked properly you can now use the software.
