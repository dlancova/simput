## SIMPUT - Simulation input

The SIMPUT (SIMulation inPUT) file format developed by Schmid et al. (2013) is a FITS-based standard for handling source descriptions for simulations of astronomical observations. A SIMPUT file describes one or more sources by information about position, flux and energy spectrum as well as optional spatial flux distribution ("images") and timing information ("lightcurves"). A full description can be downloaded [here](http://hea-www.harvard.edu/heasarc/formats/simput-1.1.0.pdf).  


This software package implements the basic features of the SIMPUT format, including tools to create simple SIMPUT files from the command line. It is part of the SIXTE software package.
